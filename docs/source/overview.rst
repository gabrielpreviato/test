Jupy4Syn Overview
=================

Jupy4Syn is a python package which provides high-level abstraction for devices manipulation,
scan routines, real-time plots and more. This package was created with the aim to provide
a simple and powerful tool to allow scientists and user to develop their own scripts for 
data acquisition.

You will find here the documentation about available resources of elaborated
softwares and scripts to provide you a set of engines to help you access
information, control and manage the most common devices in use at LNLS.  Such
documentation informs classes and methods, as well as types, formats, etc., of
input parameters and expected results.
